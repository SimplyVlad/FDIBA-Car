# BABA (Basic Autonomous Balcan Autos)

**Description** 
We are going to participate with this project in an international competition - Carolo-Cup, in Braunschweig, Germany. The student competition “Carolo-Cup” provides a platform for student teams to get involved with the conceptualization and implementation of automated model vehicles. The challenge is to realize the best performing vehicle guidance system for different scenarios, which have been derived from requirements arising from a realistic environment.
